## Movie Classifier - Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm
In this project, I built and tested a supervised machine learning k-nearest-neighbors classifier that could guess whether a movie is a comedy or a thriller, using only the number of times words appear in the movies's screenplay.

**Languages:** Python


**Libraries:** numPy, matplotlib
